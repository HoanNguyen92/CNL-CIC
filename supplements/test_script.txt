% XX We need to introduce natural number, positive, ...

Let nat be a type.
Let x, y, z, w, r, t, s stand for nat.

Axiom. (x : nat) is positive.

axiom Zero_np. (x : nat) is not positive.

Axiom.  Let x be positive.  Then (x : nat) is positive.

% test assumptions.
axiom random''. Let x be positive.  We assume y is positive.
We suppose z is positive.  Let us assume w is positive.
We can suppose that r is positive.
Let us assume that t is positive.
We can assume s is positive.
(x : nat) is not positive.

conjecture. (x : nat) is positive.

Conjecture pos_33'. (x : nat) is positive .

hypothesis A_A . (x : nat) is positive.

Hypothesis A'B.  (x : nat) is positive.

Subsection test_definition.

Subsubsection test_predicate_definition.

Definition X1. 
We say that x is remarkable iff x is positive.

Definition X2.
(x : nat) is more remarkable iff x is positive.

Definition X3.
x is called most remarkable iff x is positive.

Definition X4.
We say x is called fully remarkable iff x is positive.

Definition X5.
We say that x gobbles y iff x is positive and y is positive.

Definition X6.
x half gobbles y iff x is positive and y is positive.

Definition X7.
x contracts onto y iff x is positive and y is positive.

Definition X8.
We say that x converges iff x is positive.

Definition X9.
We say that x converges to y in the mean iff x is positive.

Definition X10.
We say that x > y iff x is positive.

Definition X11.
We say that x ++ y -- z iff y is positive.

Definition X12.
We say that x ..>.. y iff x is positive.

Definition X13.
x! iff x is positive.
